# CrackAyyware
 Simple project to decrypt/dump Ayyware BO2

Yes, I was the one who orignally cracked and leaked ayyware bo2 to the general public. Proof of this can be found in the Ayyware folder which contains the original files used to crack the cheat which have not been released publicly until now. The process is simple: compile the library, launch the original ayyware loader, and inject the library into the loader process. Run black ops 2 and a file named bo2.dll will be dumped which is the decrypted version of the bo2.img which can then be loaded with any injector of your choosing or analyzed in a disassembler (which was the reason for me writing this tool in the first place.)

No disrespect whatsoever is intended towards s4itama -- the creator of this cheat -- as it has already found it's way out onto the internet making this project obsolete for anything other than learning.
